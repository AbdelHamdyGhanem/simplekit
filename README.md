# ðŸ§° SimpleKit

A very simple user interface toolkit for teaching UI architecture.

- TypeScript and ES Modules only
- Unbundled and uncompressed exports are original source to make it easy to "Go To Definition" and trace

To experiment with it by directly modifying the code, the easiest way is to clone the git repo and use `npm link` to setup a local linked npm package.
